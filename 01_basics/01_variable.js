let accountSate; // the value is not assign the out put is undefined 

//const accountId = 14453
//accountId = 2 --- Constvalue dose not change 
console.log("accountId");

//Updating values correctly
accountEmail = "aishwarya@gmail.com"; // let value is also change
accountPassword = "22225";  // var value is also change
accountCity = "Pune"; // In JS we can write without variable -------- its not good for programer 

 
console.table({accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountSate}); // we can print value at time in table format
